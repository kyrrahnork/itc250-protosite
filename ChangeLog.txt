To Do:

admin_validate_pdo.php added 2/4/2016, will need to replace current version of 
admin_validate.php, but not in play at this time.

Write and include version specific instructions, instead of link to google doc

Needs vast cleanup, removal of extra docblocks (leave one sample only) 

Unify to a single version, merging Pager, etc. into kit

Update reCaptcha in contact, move credentials to config, add SMTP email support

Cleanup config, hide complexity
